              <p>
                The Bosporus or Bosphorus Strait is a natural strait and an
                internationally significant waterway located in Istanbul,
                Turkey. The Bosporus connects the Black Sea to the Sea of
                Marmara and forms one of the continental boundaries between Asia
                and Europe. It also divides Turkey by separating Asia Minor from
                Thrace. It is the world's narrowest strait used for
                international navigation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of the shores of the Bosporus Strait, except for the area
                to the north, are heavily settled, with the city of Istanbul's
                metropolitan population of 17 million inhabitants extending
                inland from both banks. The Bosporus Strait and the Dardanelles
                Strait at the opposite end of the Sea of Marmara are together
                known as the Turkish Straits. Sections of the shore of the
                Bosporus in Istanbul have been reinforced with concrete or
                rubble and those sections of the strait prone to deposition are
                periodically dredged.<br /><br />
